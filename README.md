# Cache System Design Project

## Description
This project implements cache replacement policies (FIFO, LRU, LFU)
for a student database system.

The dataset simulates student records stored in `student_dataset.csv`. 
Roll number and student name are the most frequently accessed fields
and are used as cache keys.

## Tools
- Python
- CSV (for database simulation)
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code / Anaconda / Notebook

## Cache Methods Implemented
1. FIFO (First In, First Out)
2. LRU (Least Recently Used)
3. LFU (Least Frequently Used)
